## History

- Started in 2010/11
- Open sourced 2012
- Pre-alpha compiler released in 2012
- Google annouces Android support 2017

???

Compare with, say Rust (2006), Clojure (2007), Scala (2004) - much newer.

.middle[# "A Better Java"]

.right[-- Andrey Breslav, Kotlin creator [(source)](https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/jvm-languages-report-extended-interview-with-kotlin-creator-andrey-breslav/)]

???

A better Java doesn't mean much to me, having only done five minutes of Java and
gone running to the hills...

---

# 1: Variations on `addTwo`

???
To start I'm going to go through a few variations on a simple theme: a function
that adds two to a number.

---
## Variation 0: A named function

```kotlin
fun addTwo (number: Int): Int {
  return number + 2
}
```

???

Nothing that exciting here - could _almost_ be writing C. Or Go.

---
## Variation 1: Single-Expression function

```kotlin
fun addTwo (number: Int): Int = number + 2
```

???

Can just assign the result as an expression - much as with Scala
(apparently - not that I've done much Scala)

---
## Variation 2: Function reference

# This doesn't work

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map(addTwo)
```

# This does

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map(::addTwo)
```

???

"Function reference" - like a pointer in C? Seems mad. Or is it like the
different lookup tables for functions and variables in Common Lisp? Anyway, not
the nicest of syntaxes.

But what if we wanted to inline the above function, like you would with
that ultimate ergonomic functional programming language...

---
# Javascript

.middle[```javascript
const listOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
listOfNumbers.map(number => number + 2)
```]

???

Javscript - hey, it's Scheme in the Browser! Woo hoo.

And as you'd expect we can do much the same with Kotlin.

---
## Variation 3: Lambda!

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map({number -> number + 2})
```

???

Kotlin looks about the same - the arrow lost some weight. This syntax is called
a Lambda, much the same as it's called in Python (or even Java these days).

The Lambdas look kinda like they do in Groovy, right? So lets use that good old
`block` syntax from Groovy - from Ruby (from Smalltalk ultimately).

---
## Variation 4: no parens for 'block'

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map { number -> number + 2 }
```

???

Hey, and does anyone remember `it` from Groovy? Well if there's only one
argument to the ~anonymous function~ Lambda, we'll just call it `it`

---
## Variation 5: with `it`

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map { it + 2 }
```

???
So there's the Groovy `it`

---
class: middle, center
## Variations so far: 5

???

So, we're up to five variations so far... but it's far from over...

---
## The point of no `return`...

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map({ number -> number + 2 })
```

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map { number -> number + 2 }
```

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map { it + 2 }
```

???

You may have noticed that the Lambdas have no return. That's because,
like in Rust or Ruby or Scheme or Common Lisp or whatever, they evaluate to
their last expression.

What if you _do_ want to return? Say a nice early return if you meet some
condition...

---
class: center, middle

# Pro tip: Don't return

---

```kotlin
fun addTwoIfThree(numbers: List<Int>): List<Int> {
  return numbers.map {
    if (it == 3) {
      return it + 2 // return bound to `addTwoIfThree`
    }
    return it
  }
}
```

This will fail to compile (`Int` is not a `List<Int>`)

???
So this doesn't work because `return` is bound to the outer, named function. We
could make this work by using the `if` as an expression (it is an expression),
but if we were severely wedded to `return` - maybe we took too much C as kids -
there is a way..

---
```kotlin
fun addTwoIfThree(numbers: List<Int>): List<Int> {
  return numbers.map {
    if (it == 3) {
      return@map it + 2 // bound to the scope of `map`
    }
    return@map it
  }
}
```

???
We can add a named return with `return@map` - this tells the Lambda where to
bind the return to - in this case the `map`. Problem solved.

But wait... isn't this confusing? What if I wanted a _real_ return?

---
## Variation 6: Anonymous Functions

```kotlin
val addTwo = fun (number: Int): Int {
  return number + 2
}
```

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map(fun (number: Int): Int {
  return number + 2
})
```

???
So there's a whole parallel syntax for declaring anonymous functions in Kotlin,
called "Anonymous Functions"

---
## Variation 7: Single-Expression AF

```kotlin
val addTwo = fun (number: Int): Int = number + 2
```

```kotlin
val listOfNumbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
listOfNumbers.map(fun (number: Int): Int = number + 2)
```

???
Yes we can do the same tricks we did with the named functions too.

---
```kotlin
fun addTwoIfThree(numbers: List<Int>): List<Int> {
  return numbers.map(fun (number: Int): Int {
    if (number == 3) {
      return number + 2 // bound to the scope of `map`
    }
    return number
  })
}
```

???
And - hooray - now I can use a real early `return` in this map.

---
class: center, middle
# Why?

???
Is this really a good idea?

- two different syntaxes for (almost) exactly the same generic concept?
- using both of the general words for that same concept (see Ruby lambda/proc)

---
class: center, middle

# Similar to:

## [Ruby `proc` vs `lambda`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/626/when-to-use-lambda-when-to-use-proc-new)

???

I've never met a Rubyist who suggests that this is a good thing.

Maybe it was a performance thing? One of the two would compile down to something
more performant?

So I did what every good developer would do and asked on Stack Overflow? My
first ever question...

---

# [My Question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48112081/why-does-kotlin-have-two-syntaxes-for-lambdas-anonymous-functions)

Actually the answer is pretty simple. And it was posted by Dmitry Jermov of
'Kotlin in Action' fame. And it has hardly any upvotes so... if anyone could
that'd be great.

## Answer: `return@` Considered Ugly

???
It was an issue of aesthetics - the `return@`

---
class: middle, center

# 2: So What?

???

So what's the big deal with the above? Why is this a bad thing - why is it even
a thing? Languages have features, languages have different ways of getting the
job done, why have I trapped you all in a room to talk about this?

---
# 1. Too much 'Syntactic Sugar'

.middle[## "Too much syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semi-colons"]

.right[-- Alan Perlis, _Epigrams on Programming_ [(source)](http://pu.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html)]

???

Syntactic sugar everywhere in Kotlin - not even touched on half of it - i.e.
infix operations

Placing the block within or outside the parenthesese (as in Ruby/Smalltalk)
good example.

Just leads to endless reformating back and forth as I change my mind about
what 'looks' right

Increases the overhead in comprehension... desperately remembering what `it`
is.

---
# 2. Mixed paradigms

.middle[## "Every sufficiently complex application/language/tool will either have to use Lisp or reinvent it the hard way."]

.right[-- Greenspuns Tenth Rule Of Programming [(source)](http://wiki.c2.com/?GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming)]

???

Kotlin is aiming towards being a more functional language - supporting a more
functional paradigm - Scala

Leads to adding more expressions into the language instead of statements...
`if` becomes an expression, Lambdas are expressions... but still keeping
traditional procedural programming elements such as `for...`

this is the seed of the `return` vs `return@` difference

---
# 3. Plain old bad design

```kotlin
val addTwo = { number ->
  number + 2
}
```

## vs.

```kotlin
val addTwo = fun (number: Int): Int {
  return number + 2
}
```

???
I'm not a language designer - thank goodness - but this seems like a bad move to
me. It adds a confusion to the heart of the language.

And it seems to be driven by the creation of a proceedural 'escape hatch' in the
middle of the language. But it's not even a _necessary_ escape hatch - they'd
already got round it with `@return` - it's just a pretty looking one.

Do we need ornate escape hatches in our languages?

But even then - what's the problem? So what, two different syntaxes for the same
thing - does that even matter?

---

# Let's Support Roman Numerals!

```kotlin
val five = V
val ten = V + 5
```

???
Imagine someone wanted to be able to write integer literals as Roman numerals?
What's the advantages to that? Hardly any - makes maybe writing the dates of
films and TV a bit easier. But the disadvantages are immense - half the team
doing arabic numerals, half doing Roman.

But in a way this is worse, because we mostly have an intuitive idea of integers.
By naming the two syntaxes after the only two vaguely neutral words for
a lambda/anonymous function, the confusion can only be compounded - write
a lambda - do you mean an anonymous function - no I mean a lambda :( - it's even
worse than Ruby.

So, yeah, I think it matters.

---

# `</rant>`

???

There's a lot about Kotlin that I do like

it's very neat the way it handles `null` as a value and turns it into something like a `Maybe`.

And the IDE support is just wonderful - made me an IntelliJ convert.

But what worries me is that it's a (relatively) young language which has already become quite
messy in this one particular area.

---

# Questions? For you?

???

So - questions - but for you?

Is this really a problem with Kotlin? Do those who write Kotlin recognise what
I'm saying?

Do all languages suffer from this sort of problem? Is it a 'new' language
issue? Is it a 'multi paradigm' language issue?

Am I just being amazingly snooty and secretly wish I was clever enough to write
Common Lisp for a living.
